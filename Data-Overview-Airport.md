# Data Overview: Airport Datasets

If you are working on scenario 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, or 10, you will be working on airfield data.

For these scenarios, imagine you are a data scientist tasked with reviewing data about various airports, heliports, and seaplane bases collected by a new field data collector in the U.S. state of Alaska for the purposes of curating a clean, tidy, and organized informational chart about these airfields for professionals.

You have some domain experience with airfields, and may have a low to moderate understanding of some of the geography in Alaska. 

Your job is to flag down inconsistencies or errors in the data provided to you so that flight planners and airspace professionals have accurate information on the airfields in the state when managing the skies.
