# Data Overview: Airport Datasets

For these scenarios, you will be working on airport/airfield data.

---

## **Attribute Definitions**
NOTE: Depending on which scenario you are working on, you may only see some of these attributes.
- **type**: The type of airfield, i.e. is it an airport, heliport, or seaplane base?
  - Possible Values:
    - **AIRPORT**: Airfields that serve passenger and cargo airplanes and other airplanes.
    - **HELIPORT**: Airfields that serve helicopters.
    - **SEAPLANE BASE**: Airfields that serve seaplanes. Seaplane bases are usually located on water, such as lakes, rivers, bays, or harbors.
- **facilityname**: The name of the airfield.
- **owner**: The person, group, or entity that owns the airfield.
- **manager**: The person/people or entity that manages/oversees the day-to-day function of this particular airfield. NOTE: Managers can manage multiple airfields, and some airfields do not have a manager. Airfields with no manager use a manager value of "NO MANAGER," and an occurrence of "NO MANAGER" does not necessarily mean the value is an error.
