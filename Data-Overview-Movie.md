## **Attribute Definitions**
NOTE: Depending on which scenario you are working on, you may only be working with a subset of these attributes.
- **listingnumber**: The database's listing number for this movie or TV show.
- **title**: The title of the movie or TV show.
- **year**: The year the movie or TV show was released in.
- **rating**: The content rating of the movie or TV show, as defined by the Movie Picture Association of America (MPAA) or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), respectively. NOTE: Some listings have not received a rating from the MPAA or FCC. These examples have a rating value of "Not Rated," and an occurrence of "Not Rated" does not necessarily mean the value is an error.
- **director**: The person who directed the movie or TV show. For movies or shows with more than one director but one person that was the lead director, this person is listed as the director in the dataset.
- **genre**: The genre of the movie or TV show, e.g. action, drama, horror, comedy, etc.
