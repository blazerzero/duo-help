# Interface Guide

## **How to Give or Change Feedback**
To mark a cell as noisy/erroneous, click on the cell. The cell will be highlighted yellow. If you decide at any point this cell is not an error, you can simply click on it again to unmark it, and it will be unhighlighted.

---

## **Your Feedback Persists Throughout the Interaction**
Your feedback will be visible throughout the entire interaction, e.g. if you marked a cell as erroneous in a previous iteration, and that tuple/row occurs in a subsequent iteration, the cell will reappear as highlighted so that you can review your previous feedback alongside new data.

## **What Do I Do if I Don't Have Any New Feedback or Changes?**
If you do not see any new errors or any changes to previous feedback that need to be made, simply click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to see a new sample of data.

---

## **What Do I Do if I Don't Have Any More Feedback Left to Give?**
If you have no more feedback left to give or are otherwise done giving feedback, simply click "Done" to tell the system you're done with the scenario.

## **The System is Learning From You**
If it looks like the system is not responding to your feedback with its own error markings, don‚Äôt worry! The system is learning from you and is not trying to step over your work üòä
